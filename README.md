# FriendFinder

### What is Friend Finder?
Friend Finder is an application that requires you to answer questions about yourself in a survey. Friend Finder will take your survey results and will compare them to the answers of other users (aka potential "friends"). Friend Finder will then report back the name and photo of the user that had answers most similar to yours. 

### How do I get started with Friend Finder?

Below is a description (with screenshots) of how you will interact with the application.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the live application: https://rs-friend-finder.herokuapp.com/.

**Step 2:** Click the "Go to Survey" button.

**Step 3:** Fill in your name. If you do not fill in your name and you try to submit, you will receive an error. 

**Step 4:** Provide a link to your photo. If you do not provide a photo and you try to submit, you will receive an error. 

**Step 5:** Select the option that most accurately represent your feelings about the questions displayed to you. You must select an option for all 10 questions or you will receive an error.

**Step 6:** Once you provide all required information (your name and photo) and provided answers to all 10 questions, press the submit button. Based on your answers, the application will provide you with name and photo of your most compatible friend.
